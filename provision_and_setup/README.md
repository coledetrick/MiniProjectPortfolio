The goal of this project was to write a Terraform script that will create an ec2 instance on AWS using a predetermined AMI.
Once the ec2 instance was created, write an ansible playbook to provision the server to serve a static HTML website, using nginx.
This project allowed me to solidify the basics of using IaC tools like ansible and terraform to work with AWS and linux resources.

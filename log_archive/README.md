The original goal for these scripts was to build a tool to archive logs on a set schedule by compressing them and storing them in a new directory, this is especially useful for removing old logs and keeping the system clean while maintaining the logs in a compressed format for future reference. I did modify this goal for a current usecase of mine, so in my scripts I ask the user for input on files they want archived. This project helped me practice working with files and directories and refining some programming concepts.

The scripts ask the user for a file name of the file they want archived, then uses tar to compress them and move the file to a different directory for archival.

The goal of this script was to write a simple tool to analyze logs from the command line, specifically nginx logs to grab whatever information you want.
The data my script looks for is as follows:
|Metrics | | | |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IP address | Date and time | Request method and path | Response status code |
| Response size | Referrer | User agent
